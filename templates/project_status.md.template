- [ ] Tier 1: Input system (all key bindings documented)
- [ ] Tier 1: UI system (base classes, text access patterns)
- [ ] Tier 2: Game mechanics (analyzed as needed per feature)
- [ ] Tier 2: Status/feedback systems
- [ ] Tier 2: Event system / Harmony patch points
- [ ] Tier 3: Localization system
- [ ] Tier 3: Tutorial analysis
- [ ] Results documented in `docs/game-api.md`

## Implemented Features

List features with their status:

- (none yet)

<!-- Example:
- **Main Menu Navigation** - DONE - Arrow keys navigate, Enter activates
- **Settings Menu** - DONE - All sliders and toggles accessible
- **Inventory** - IN PROGRESS - Basic navigation works, item details missing
- **Status Announcements** - PLANNED - F2 for health, F3 for resources
-->

## Pending Tests

What the user should test in the next game session:

- (none yet)

<!-- Example:
- Main menu: Check if all 5 menu items are announced with arrow keys
- Settings: Test slider, check if percentage is read aloud
- Try pressing F2 during gameplay — should announce health
-->

## Known Issues

- (none yet)

<!-- Example:
- Menu navigation sometimes skips an item when scrolling fast
- Shop prices not announced for bundled items
-->

## Architecture Decisions

Document important decisions so future sessions understand the reasoning:

- (none yet)

<!-- Example:
- Using ReflectionHelper for all UI text access (most fields are private)
- State management via AccessStateManager (3+ handlers share arrow keys)
- Manual Harmony patching in OnSceneWasLoaded (typeof() crashes at assembly load)
-->

## Key Bindings (Mod)

- F1: Help
- F12: Toggle debug mode
<!-- Add more as features are implemented -->

## Notes for Next Session

Write anything the next conversation needs to know:

- (none yet)

<!-- Example:
- Left off debugging the inventory handler - item count is correct but item names show as "Unknown"
- Need to check if InventorySlot uses m_ItemName or title field
- User wants crafting menu next
-->
